## Objective
1.	Create a functional application with a polished UI
2.	Have random cat facts (see 3a)

b.	Could likely work for cats or dogs if the adoption API specifies breed … just substitute / alternate the URL it pulls the info from
3.	Have pictures that match the cat breed
a.	Change to have facts that match the animal available for adoption if the API specifies breed
4.	Have local storage  
a.	Save customer’s zip code to find local animals for adoption
b.	Ability to save your favorite animals to compare before adopting
c.	Include the contact info for the adoption center location specific to the pet
5.	Ability to send a link to your favorite animal/s via email to a friend
6.	Provide the best cat breed suggestion 

## Description/Usage: 
Pet Purrfect is an app that allows a user to search through a list of cat breeds, returning a cute picture and pertinent info about said breed, the app also contains a search function for available adoptable cats in the user’s area!


## Approach
Agile Methodology

## Final Statements/ Conclusion
Attempted to use the CURL and learned it was out of scope.  
Used the POST method and we are more aware how documentation for API varies. 
Learned to use authentication/token request and client secret/bearer token. 
We learned there were 2 version of an API.  Version 1 did not work.
